SharkTap
========

Shark Tap is an iOS game that I developed using the SpriteKit framework. It runs on version iOS 7.0 or higher on iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

The concept of the game is to tap near a paricular distance from the swimming sharks to get points. The higher the points, the harder it is the "eat" the sharks because of the increase in speed and AI.
