SharkTap
========

Shark Tap is an iOS game that I developed using the SpriteKit framework. It runs on version iOS 7.0 or higher on iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

The concept of the game is to tap near a paricular distance from the swimming sharks to get points. The higher the points, the harder it is the "eat" the sharks because of the increase in speed and AI.

To run, open the Xcode project in this repository.
